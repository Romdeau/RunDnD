#RunDnD

###Introduction
Run DnD is a set of tools I use to run my DnD campaign.

## Prerequisites
This is a meteor project, so you're going to need Meteor Installed.

## Getting Started
Just run `meteor` in the directory, Meteor will build itself and download its dependent packages itself. It should then be accessible from http://localhost:3000/.
If you want to run this on a server see Deploying below.

## Deploying
You're going to need to have
* MongoDB
* NodeJS

Create the deployable package
Set it up with NodeJS
Connect Database
